# Frequent asked questions

!!! question "I already got a lab installed with v2, is v3 will use it ?"
    Sorry no, the v3 of GOAD doesn't look for already installed lab. Best way to migrate is trash your old lab and build a new one.

!!! question "Can i use goad to create a course for my student ?"
    Sure GOAD is a GPL project. Feel free to reuse it to give course.
